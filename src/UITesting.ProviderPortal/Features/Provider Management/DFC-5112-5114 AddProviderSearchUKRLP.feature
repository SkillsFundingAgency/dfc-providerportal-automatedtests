Feature: DFC-5112-5114 AddProviderSearchUKRLP
As a user I want to search the UKRLP using a UKPRN
so that I can check that the provider has a valid record on the UK Register of Learning Providers (UKRLP)


Background:  
Given I have accessed course directory as a provider
And I login as admin with user and password
Then I am logged in
Given I have searched for UKPRN "10002815" and clicked search
When I click to view my courses
## End of Provider Search Steps
Given I am on Add a Provider Page
Then I should see label "Add Provider"
And I should see another label "Enter UKPRN number"
And I should see a text input field
And I should see a search icon
