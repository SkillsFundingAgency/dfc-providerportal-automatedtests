The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.

The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occid"
